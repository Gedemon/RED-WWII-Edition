After the Great War ("La Der des Ders" as we thougth then) our nation had to rebuild herself, but just after we were plunged into the world depression and now things get worse as acts of agression increase in Europe and the Pacific. Now the world looks to our power to counter the rise of facism and the ideals of militarism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As peace is more and more uncertain, the people of France have chosen you to be their leader in these hard times.

				The Invasion of Poland caused France and Britain to declare war against Germany. But the Allies did not launch massive assaults and kept a defensive stance: this was called the Phoney War in Britain or Drôle de guerre—the funny sort of war—in France. It did not prevent the German army from conquering Poland in a matter of weeks with its innovative Blitzkrieg tactics and helped by the Soviet Union's attack on Poland. When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, the Battle of France began in May 1940, and the same tactics proved just as devastating there. The Wehrmacht bypassed the Maginot Line by marching through the Ardennes forest. A second German force was sent into Belgium and the Netherlands to act as a diversion to this main thrust. In six weeks of savage fighting the French lost 90,000 men. Many civilians sought refuge by taking to the roads of France: some two million refugees from Belgium and Holland were joined by between eight and ten million French civilians, representing a quarter of the French population, all heading south and west. This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				French leaders surrendered to Nazi Germany on 24 June 1940, after the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk. Nazi Germany occupied three fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy government. This regime sought to collaborate with Germany. It was established on 10 July 1940. The Vichy Regime was led by Philippe Pétain, the aging war hero of First World war. It was originally intended to be a temporary, care-taker regime, to supervise French administration before the soon-expected defeat of Britain. Instead, it lasted four years. It was unique among the various collaborating regimes of wartime Europe in that it was established constitutionally, through the French parliament. However, Charles de Gaulle declared himself on Radio Londres the head of a rival government in exile, gathering the Free French Forces around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain and the USA.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Vichy regime adopted violent, repressive anti-semitic policies on its own initiative, without direction from Nazi Germany. During the German occupation 76,000 Jews would be deported, often with the help of the Vichy French authorities, and murdered in the Nazis' extermination camps. After the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of Vichy France, that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the Battle of Dakar. Eventually, several important French ships such as the Richelieu and the Surcouf joined the Free French Forces. On the Eastern Front the USSR was lacking pilots and several French pilots joined the Soviet Union and fought the Luftwaffe in the Normandie-Niemen squadron. Within France proper, very few people organized themselves against the German Occupation in the summer of 1940. However, their numbers grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. Isolated opposers eventually formed a real movement: the Resistance. There were also Frenchmen who joined the SS, they were known as the Charlemagne Division; knowing they would not survive should Germany be defeated, they were among the last ones to surrender at Berlin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In November 1942 Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces, because the war in North Africa was coming to an end; the Germans foresaw a threat in southern Europe by the allied forces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				In 1935, Germany reacquired control of the Saar and in 1936 military control of the Rhineland, both of which had been lost in the Treaty of Versailles. In 1938 and 1939, Austria and Czechoslovakia were brought under German control and the invasion of Poland was prepared through the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and Operation Himmler. On 1 September 1939 the German Wehrmacht launched a blitzkrieg on Poland, which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet Red Army. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				As the war progressed, Germany and its allies quickly gained control of much of continental Europe while the plan to occupy the United Kingdom failed. On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and invaded the Soviet Union. The same year, Japan attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor, and Germany declared war on the United States. The Battle of Stalingrad forced the German army to retreat on the Eastern front. In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German troops were forced to defend an additional front in Italy. D-Day opened a Western front, as Allied forces advanced towards German territory. On 8 May 1945, the German armed forces surrendered after the Red Army occupied Berlin.

			<Text>The United Kingdom, along with the British Empire's crown colonies, especially British India, declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939, after the German invasion of Poland. Hostilities with Japan began in 1941, after it attacked British colonies in Asia. Following the defeat of its European allies, in the first year of the war, the United Kingdom continued the fight against Germany which took form with notable periods such as the Battle of Britain and the Battle of the Atlantic. Following the D-Day landings and the subsequent defeat of Germany and her allies, the UK was one of the "Big Three" that met at the end of the war to plan the postwar world. The war left the United Kingdom financially damaged although aid from the Marshall Plan and loans taken from both the United States and Canada helped the UK on the road to recovery.</Text>

				In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Consequently, Italy allied with Nazi Germany and Empire of Japan and strongly supported Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy occupied Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades, and entered World War II in 1940 on the side of the Axis powers. Mussolini, wanting a quick victory like Hitler's Blitzkriegs in Poland and France, invaded Greece in October 1940 but was forced to accept a humiliating stalemate after a few months. At the same time, Italy, after initially conquering British Somalia and parts of Egypt, saw an allied counter-attack lead to the loss of all possessions in the Horn of Africa and in North Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Italy was then invaded by the Allies in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini. In September 1943, Italy surrendered. The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war, as the allies were moving up from the south as the north was the base for loyalist Italian fascist and German Nazi forces, fought also by the Italian resistance movement.The hostilities ended on 2 May 1945. Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict, and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century.

				In 1938, after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks. The two countries concluded the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement. The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland. In late November of the same year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Japanese Empire in 1938 and 1939. However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although it has been debated whether the Soviet Union had any intention of invading Germany once it was strong enough, Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the "Great Patriotic War". The Red Army stopped the seemingly-invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow, aided by an unusually harsh winter. The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point of the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945. This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.

				Despite the country's numerically small and ill-equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the Allied efforts in World War II. At the start of the war Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Mussolini ultimatum demanding occupation rights to strategic Greek sites. When the Italian envoy presented these demands on 28 October 1940 to the Greek prime Minister Metaxas, he was met with a curt reply: "Alors, c'est la guerre" ("then it is war"). Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle. This marked the first Allied victory in the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Primarily to secure his strategic southern flank, German dictator Adolf Hitler reluctantly stepped in and launched the Battle of Greece. Troops from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy successfully invaded Greece, through Yugoslavia, overcoming Greek, British, Australian, and New Zealand units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				On 20 May 1941, the Germans attempted to seize Crete with a large attack by paratroops—with the aim of reducing the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in Egypt—but faced heavy resistance. The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against Soviet Union and the heavy losses of German paratroopers led the Germans to launch no further large-scale air-invasions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				During the years of Occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany, thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the Jewish community despite efforts by the Greek Orthodox Church and many other Christian Greeks to shelter the Jews. The economy of Greece was devastated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When the Soviet Army began its drive across Romania in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece into Yugoslavia and Albania to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. British troops landed on 4 October in Patras, and entered Athens at October 13.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				During the period between 1942 and 1944, known as the first phase of the greek civil wars, marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement. In the second phase (1944) the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek government in exile, which had been formed under Western Allied auspices in Cairo and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers. In the third phase (commonly called the "Third Round" by the Communists) (1946–1949), guerrilla forces controlled by KKE fought against the internationally recognized Greek Government which was formed after elections boycotted by KKE.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization; as a result, Greece also entered into alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its Communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained.

				A veteran of World War I, in the 1920s and 1930s de Gaulle came to the fore as a proponent of mobile armoured divisions, which he considered would become central in modern warfare. During World War II, he reached the temporary rank of Brigadier General, leading one of the few successful armoured counter-attacks during the 1940 Battle of France, and then briefly served in the French government as France was falling.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				He escaped to Britain and gave a famous radio address, broadcast by the BBC on 18 June 1940, exhorting the French people to resist Nazi Germany and organised the Free French Forces with exiled French officers in Britain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				He gradually obtained control of all French colonies except Indochina—most of which had at first been controlled by the pro-German Vichy regime—and by the time of the liberation of France in 1944 he was heading a government in exile, insisting that France be treated as an independent great power by the other Allies. De Gaulle became prime minister in the French Provisional Government, resigning in 1946 due to political conflicts.('from Wikipedia')

				Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party. He was Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and, after 1934, also head of state as Führer und Reichskanzler, ruling the country as an absolute dictator.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				A decorated veteran of World War I, Hitler joined the precursor of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1919 and became leader of NSDAP in 1921. He attempted a failed coup called the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in 1923, for which he was imprisoned. Following his imprisonment, in which he wrote Mein Kampf, he gained support by promoting German nationalism, anti-semitism, anti-capitalism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and propaganda. He was appointed chancellor in 1933, and quickly transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideals of national socialism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Hitler ultimately wanted to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe. To achieve this, he pursued a foreign policy with the declared goal of seizing Lebensraum for the Aryan people; directing the resources of the state towards this goal. This included the rearmament of Germany, which culminated in 1939 when the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. In response, the United Kingdom and France declared war against Germany, leading to the outbreak of World War II in Europe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Within three years, Germany and the Axis powers had occupied most of Europe, and most of Northern Africa, East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean. However, with the reversal of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the Allies gained the upper hand from 1942 onwards. By 1945, Allied armies had invaded German-held Europe from all sides. Nazi forces engaged in numerous violent acts during the war, including the systematic murder of as many as 17 million civilians, including an estimated six million Jews targeted in the Holocaust and between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma, Poles, Soviet civilians, Soviet prisoners of war, people with disabilities, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other political and religious opponents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time mistress Eva Braun and, to avoid capture by Soviet forces less than two days later, the two committed suicide on 30 April 1945. ('from Wikipedia')

				Mussolini became the 40th Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and began using the title Il Duce by 1925. After 1936, his official title was "His Excellency Benito Mussolini, Head of Government, Duce of Fascism, and Founder of the Empire". Mussolini also created and held the supreme military rank of First Marshal of the Empire along with King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, which gave him and the King joint supreme control over the military of Italy. Mussolini remained in power until he was replaced in 1943; for a short period after this until his death, he was the leader of the Italian Social Republic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Mussolini was among the founders of Italian Fascism, which included elements of nationalism, corporatism, national syndicalism, expansionism, social progress, and anti-socialism in combination with censorship of subversives and state propaganda. In the years following his creation of the Fascist ideology, Mussolini influenced, or achieved admiration from, a wide variety of political figures. ('from Wikipedia')

				Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18 December 1878 - 5 March 1953) was a Georgian-born, Soviet politician and Bolshevik revolutionary, who held the position of first General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee from 1922 until his death in 1953. While formally the office of the General Secretary was elective and was not initially regarded as the top position in the Soviet state, after Vladimir Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin managed to consolidate more and more power in his hands, gradually putting down all opposition groups within the party. This included Leon Trotsky, the Red Army organizer, proponent of world revolution, and principal critic of Stalin among the early Soviet leaders, who was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929. Instead, Stalin's idea of socialism in one country became the primary line of the Soviet politics. ('from Wikipedia')

			<Text>
				HMS Hood (pennant number 51) was the last battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				One of four Admiral-class battlecruisers ordered in mid-1916, her design—although drastically revised after the Battle of Jutland and improved while she was under construction—still had serious limitations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				For this reason she was the only ship of her class to be completed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				She was named after the 18th-century Admiral Samuel Hood.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When war with Germany was declared in September 1939, Hood was operating in the area around Iceland, and spent the next several months hunting between Iceland and the Norwegian Sea for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After a brief overhaul to her engine plant, she sailed as the flagship of Force H, and participated in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Relieved as flagship of Force H, Hood was dispatched to Scapa Flow, and operated in the area as a convoy escort and later as a defence against a potential German invasion fleet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In May 1941, she and the battleship HMS Prince of Wales were ordered to intercept the German battleship Bismarck which was en route to attack convoys in the Atlantic.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				On 24 May 1941, Hood was struck by several German shells early in the Battle of the Denmark Strait and exploded; the loss had a profound effect on the British.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to "sink the Bismarck", and they fulfilled his command on 26–27 May.

				Iowa was decommissioned for the last time in 1990, and was initially struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1995.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				She was reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two Iowa-class battleships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Richelieu class battleships were the last and largest battleships of the French Navy, staying in service into the 1960s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Designed in the 1930s to counter of threat of the Italian Vittorio Veneto class battleships, the Richelieu class were essentially scaled-up versions of the preceding Dunkerque class, featuring a main armament of eight 380 mm guns in two quadruple turrets in forward superfiring positions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Four Richelieu class ships, of three different subclasses, were laid down over the course of three naval construction programs, in 1935, 1936, and 1938. Only the two first units, Richelieu and Jean Bart, were ever completed, and saw service during World War II, first under Vichy control in Dakar (1940) and Casablanca (1942), then under the Allies' control, Richelieu participating in British Home Fleet and Eastern Fleet operations, and supported the French forces return to Indochina in late 1945.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Jean Bart was not completed until the 1950s, and took part in the operations off Port Saïd (Egypt) during the Suez Crisis in 1956.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				Bismarck was the first of two Bismarck-class battleships built for the German Kriegsmarine during World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The ship was named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the primary force behind the German unification in 1871.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Along with her sister ship Tirpitz, Bismarck was the largest battleship ever built by Germany, and the heaviest built by any European power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation, codenamed Rheinübung, in May 1941.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The ship, along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, was to break out into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, however, and British naval units were deployed to block their route.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				At the Battle of Denmark Strait, Bismarck engaged and destroyed the battlecruiser HMS Hood, the pride of the Royal Navy, and forced the battleship HMS Prince of Wales to retreat with heavy damage, although in the end Bismarck herself was hit three times and suffered an oil leak from a ruptured tank following the hits.
				The destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy with dozens of warships involved.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Two days later, while steaming for the relative safety of occupied France, Bismarck was attacked by Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal; one hit was scored that jammed the battleship's steering gear and rendered her unmanoeuvrable.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The following morning, Bismarck suffered heavy damage from the battleships HMS King Georges V and HMS Rodney, she was scuttled by her crew and in June 1989, Robert Ballard discovered the location of Bismarck's wreck.

				She was named after the Russian victory over the Swedish Navy in the Battle of Gangut in 1714.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

			<Text>
				The dreadnought was the predominant type of 20th-century battleship.[NEWLINE]
				The first of the kind, the Royal Navy's Dreadnought had such an impact when launched in 1906 that battleships built after her were referred to as 'dreadnoughts', and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Her design had two revolutionary features: an 'all-big-gun' armament scheme and steam turbine propulsion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The arrival of the dreadnoughts renewed the naval arms race, principally between the United Kingdom and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial symbol of national power.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The term 'dreadnought' gradually dropped from use after World War I, especially after the Washington Naval Treaty, as all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; it can also be used to describe battlecruisers, the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.

				The South Dakota-class was a group of four fast battleships built by the United States Navy. They were the second class of battleships to be named after the 40th State; the first class was designed in the 1920s and canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The class comprised four ships: South Dakota, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Alabama. They were more compact and better protected than the preceding North Carolina class, but had the same main battery, nine 16-inch (406 mm)/45-caliber guns in triple turrets. The ships can be visually distinguished from the earlier vessels by their single funnel, compared to twin funnels in the North Carolinas. According to authors William Garzke and Robert Dulin, the South Dakota design was the best "treaty battleship" ever built.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Construction began shortly before World War II, with Fiscal Year (FY) 1939 appropriations. Commissioning through the summer of 1942, the four ships served in both the Atlantic, ready to intercept possible German capital ship sorties. As the U.S. went on the offensive in the Central Pacific, they joined in escorting the fast carrier task forces, a job for which their heavy anti-aircraft gun batteries were well-suited. They also employed their main battery guns in shore bombardment, and were kept ready to form battle line in case their Japanese opposite numbers should appear. All four ships were retired post-war; South Dakota and Indiana were scrapped, while Massachusetts and Alabama were retained as museum ships.

			<Text>
				The Scharnhorst class were the first capital ships, alternatively referred to as battlecruisers or battleships, built for the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) after World War I. The class comprised two vessels: the lead ship Scharnhorst and Gneisenau.[NEWLINE]Scharnhorst was launched first, and so she is considered to be the lead ship by some sources; however, they are also referred to as the Gneisenau class in some other sources, as Gneisenau was the first to be laid down and commissioned. They marked the beginning of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles.[NEWLINE]The ships were armed with nine 28 cm (11 in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm (15 in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The two ships were laid down in 1935, launched in late 1936, and commissioned into the German fleet by early 1939. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau operated together for much of the early portion of World War II, including sorties into the Atlantic to raid British merchant shipping. The two ships participated in Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. During operations off Norway, the two ships engaged the battlecruiser HMS Renown and sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious— in the engagement with Glorious, Scharnhorst achieved one of the longest-range naval gunfire hits in history. In early 1942, the two ships made a daylight dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In late 1942, Gneisenau was heavily damaged in an Allied air raid against Kiel. In early 1943, Scharnhorst joined the Bismarck class battleship Tirpitz in Norway to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. Scharnhorst and several destroyers sortied from Norway to attack a convoy; the Germans were instead intercepted by British naval patrols. During the battle of North Cape, the Royal Navy battleship HMS Duke of York sank Scharnhorst. In the meantime, repair work on Gneisenau had begun, and the ship was in the process of being rearmed. However, when Scharnhorst was sunk, work on her sister was abandoned. Instead, she was sunk as a blockship in Gdynia in 1945; the wreck was broken up for scrap in the 1950s.

				At the begining of the war, it was clear that the French and the British Armies didn't have enough materials to do a long war against Germany. They turned to the USA for help providing war material, and despite the USA were a neutral nation, Roosevelt signed a pact to authorize to give materials to their future allies. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				They started to send material and equipments by sea to supply the United Kingdom, but rapidly the KriegsMarine brought her submarines to attack the isolated transports crossing the Atlantic ocean. To avert the danger, the allies started to form convoys of transport ships protected by destroyers and other escort ships, and material was brought more safely to its destination. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Convoys were also used in the Pacific and the Indian oceans by the allies and the axis to transport troops and material, and even to North Sea where Germans brought Iron coming from Sweden via Narvik.

				Greek infantry was neither advanced nor numerous, and its military had suffered recent casualties from numerous wars against its neighbour, Turkey. This recent exposure to military action provided the front line infantry with operational experience.  That knowledge, and their great devotion to protecting Greece from invaders, made them an effective fighting force.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When Fascist Italy invaded from Albania, Greek troops showed their strength and determination by forcing the Italians back across the Albanian border.  Unfortunately for the Greeks, Hitler wanted to protect his ally’s reputation, and Germany invaded Greece on 6 April 1941, conquering the country within a month.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Throughout the occupation, Greek resistance sprung up numerous times even managing to liberate several mountainous regions from German occupation.  Unfortunately, large scale resistance beyond that was limited due to civil conflict between the different factions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The government in exile formed armed forces and, fighting alongside the British, engaged the Axis troops in North Africa, the Middle East, and Italy.

				At the end of the Great War, Britain found itself wanting in regards to the number of soldiers in its military, as close to a million had been lost.  At the outbreak of the Second World War Britain had a small army compared to other nations (9 available divisions compared to Germany’s 78 and France’s 86), and after declaring war on Germany, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was dispatched to France.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After the fall of France, most of the remaining BEF was rescued from Dunkirk by the British Navy and civilian craft.  The British would continue to engage the Axis forces on many fronts, including Greece, North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Norway, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				British troops would also take part during the D-Day landings, storming beaches Sword and Gold, and continuing on against German forces throughout Northern France, The Low Countries, and Germany itself.

				At the outbreak of the Second World War, France had the largest army in Europe, sporting 86 divisions.  After Germany declared war on Poland, and France’s subsequent declaration of war on Germany, the first few months were spend by the infantry relaxing.  They entered into Germany against little resistance, but shortly left.  With the exception of fighting in Norway, they then sat and waited during the time known as the Phoney War, snug in their Maginot Line fortifications. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In the spring of 1940, the French were outflanked by the Wehrmacht, who attacked through the Low Countries, completely ignoring the Maginot Line defenses.  Although the French infantry fought fiercely, they were unprepared for the new armoured tactics devised by Germany, and soon they were routed and Paris was captured.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The war was not over for the French infantry, however.  Although many of the survivors of the Battle of France remained in the military under Vichy Rule and some even joined the S.S., there were those who joined the Free French forces outside of the country, eventually reaching 400,000 volunteers.  Under the command of General Charles de Gaul, La France Libre forces continued to do battle against the Axis forces, engaging them in Crete, Libya, Tunisia, East Africa, and Italy.  After D-Day, they once again fought on their home soil, and battled through Belgium into Germany.

				As the Doughboys returned home at the end of the Great War, the 500,000-strong National Army was disbanded and the United States of America would sit through the interwar years with a relatively small Regular Army of about 175,000.  As war broke out in Europe for the second time that century, the United States attempted to remain neutral, again.  As the war escalated, it seemed that America would not be able to maintain its neutrality and would be drawn into another war in Europe.  So, a slow military build-up began. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				On "December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."  Overnight, America was embroiled in a war with Japan.  Four days later, Adolph Hitler declared war on the U.S.A., pulling the isolationist nation into the war in Europe, as well.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In response to this sudden state of war, a new National Army was formed as a successor to the one that had been disbanded.  Armed with the trusty M1 Garand, a strong national pride, and a new helmet design (replacing the old British version), the American Infantry would engage the enemy all over the globe, from Tunisia and Guadalcanal to Monte Casino, Iwo Jima, and Normandy.

				The Renault R35, an abbreviation of Char léger Modèle 1935 R or R 35, was a French light infantry tank of the Second World War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Designed from 1933 and produced from 1936, the type was intended as a light infantry support tank, equipping autonomous tank battalions, that would be allocated to individual infantry divisions to assist them in executing offensive operations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				To this end it was relatively well-armoured but slow and lacking a good antitank-capacity, fitted with a short 37 mm gun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The R 35 was intended to replace the FT 17 as standard light infantry tank from the summer of 1936, but even by May 1940 not enough conscripts had been retrained and therefore eight battalions of the older tank had to be kept operational.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				On 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of war, 975 vehicles had been delivered out of 1070 produced; 765 were fielded by tank battalions in France, 49 used for drive training, 33 were in depot and 45 present in the colonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Of a total order for 2,300 at least 1,601 had been produced until 1 June 1940 — the numbers for that month are lacking — but 245 had been exported: to Poland (50), Turkey (100; two batches of fifty each in February and March 1940), Romania (41 from an order for 200), and Yugoslavia (54).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The SOMUA S35 was a French Cavalry tank of the Second World War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Built from 1936 until 1940 to equip the armoured divisions of the Cavalry, it was for its time a relatively agile medium-weight tank, superior in armour and armament to both its French and foreign competitors, such as the contemporary versions of the German Panzerkampfwagen III.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was constructed from well-sloped, mainly cast, armour sections, that however made it expensive to produce and time-consuming to maintain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				During the German invasion of May 1940, the SOMUA S35 proved itself to be a tactically effective type, but this was negated by strategic mistakes in deploying its units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After the defeat of France in June 1940, limiting production to a number of 430, captured SOMUA S35s were used by the Axis powers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				A derived type, the SOMUA S40, with an improved suspension, lowered hull cast and welded turret armour, had been planned to replace the original version on the production lines in July 1940.

				The Char B1 was a French heavy tank manufactured before World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Char B1 was a specialised heavy break-through vehicle, originally conceived as a self-propelled gun with a 75 mm howitzer in the hull;[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				later a 47 mm gun in a turret was added, to allow it to function also as a Char de Bataille, a "battle tank" fighting enemy armour, equipping the armoured divisions of the Infantry Arm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Among the most powerfully armed and armoured tanks of its day, the type was very effective in direct confrontations with German armour in 1940 during the Battle of France,	but slow speed and high fuel consumption made it ill-adapted to the war of movement then being fought.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After the defeat of France, captured Char B1 (bis) would be used by Germany with some rebuilt as flamethrowers or mechanised artillery.

				The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. The name is short for the German Panzerkampfwagen I (armored fighting vehicle mark I), abbreviated PzKpfw I. The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz 101 (special purpose vehicle 101).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production in 1934. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the Panzer I saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Experiences with the Panzer I during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German armored corps' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				By 1941, the Panzer I chassis design was used for production of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its service history, including by foreign nations to extend the design lifespan. It continued to serve in the armed forces of Spain until 1954.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Panzer I's performance in combat was limited by its thin armor and light armament of two general purpose machine guns. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was not as capable as other light tanks of the era, such as the T-26.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although weak in combat, it formed a large portion of Germany's tank strength in numbers and was used in all major campaigns between September 1939 and December 1941. The small, vulnerable light tank would be surpassed in importance by better-known German tanks such as the Panzer IV, Panther, and Tiger.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Nevertheless, the Panzer I's contribution to the early victories of Nazi Germany during the Second World War was significant.

				The Panzer II was the common name for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II (abbreviated PzKpfw II).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				By the end of 1942 it had been largely removed from front line service, and production of the tank itself ceased by 1943. Its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armored vehicles.

				The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Tank Mark IV), otherwise known as the Panzer IV, was a medium infantry support tank used by Germany and its allies during the Second World War. It was the most produced German tank during the war, with more than 8,800 produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The first models were infantry support tanks, armed with stubby 75mm KwK L/24. As the Panzer III became increasingly obsolete, the Wehrmacht needed a tank that could fight other tank effectively. The F2 and G models had not only Anti-tank guns (KwK L/43 on the F2, a KwK L/48 on the G) that had better armor penetration than the F-32 gun on the Soviet T-34/76, the armor was upgraded as well. A further variant, the H had side skirts to protect against small arms and explosives. Late in the war, the Panzer IVH was proven to be inferior to the Panther and Tiger, but still a capable adversary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				While production was stopped in late 1944, they were used up until the very end of the war. The chassis was the base for many Tank Destroyers, SPGs, and Anti-Aircraft guns. The last known usage of the Panzer IV was during the Six-Day War (1967) by the Syrians.

				In answer to the powerful Soviet T-34 and KV-1 mechanized units, the Panzerkempfwagon VI Tiger Ausf.E was manufactured by Henschel from 1942 to 1944 and remained in service until the end of the war. It was one of the most powerful tanks used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. Hosting a crew of 5, the Tiger possessed a powerful main gun (88 mm), two secondary guns (7.92 mm MG 34), and thick armour plating (25-110 mm). Unfortunately, the Tiger was held back by the its high fuel consumption, limited mobile range, and frequent breakdowns. A fierce weapon on the field, more Tigers were lost due to malfunction and self-destruction then at the hands of the enemy. Despite these flaws, the tiger was generally feared by its opponents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Tiger was also too wide and heavy for many small bridges, so it was designed to be able to, after a lengthy setup period, ford four meter deep water (two meter for later models).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The first major use of the Tiger was at the Battle of Kursk, but it found use on all German battlefronts, including France, Italy, and North Africa where they dominated in the open terrain despite being deployed in small numbers. A testament to the Tigers durability, even though only 1,347 were manufactured and all before 1944, many remained in action until the end of the war.

				The ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 182.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It is also known under the informal name Königstiger (the German name for the "Bengal tiger"), often translated as King Tiger or Royal Tiger by Allied soldiers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Tiger II combined the thick armor of the Tiger I with the sloped armor used on the Panther medium tank.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180 mm (3.9 to 7.1 in) of armor to the front, and was armed with the long barrelled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless tank destroyer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army (Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung - abbreviated s.H.Pz.Abt) and the Waffen-SS (s.SS.Pz.Abt).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army, seeing service as a substitute for the Panzer III in the invasions of Poland and Russia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Production ended in 1942, when its armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1400 were manufactured.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was an export success: 50 were exported to Iran, 24 each to Peru and Switzerland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Panzer 38(t) was manufactured up to the middle of World War II. The small turret was incapable of taking a weapon big enough to destroy late-war tanks, and manufacturing of the tank version ceased.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				However, the chassis continued in production as the basis for several turretless assault guns, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns. A Swedish variant, the Sav m/43, remained in use until 1970.

				The Tank, Light, Mk VIB was a British light tank of the Second World War. It was mostly out classed by the other tank designs of the war and led to the British Army largely abandoning the light tank concept during the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When it was first produced in 1936 the British Army believed it was the best light tank in the world. In the years up to World War Two it was generally used in colonial policing duty where it excelled. During the peiod of rearnament it was the only tank that was ready to be manufactured, and as a result at the outbreak of war the Mk VIB comprised the vast majority of tanks in use with the British Army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was the main tank used by the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of France, proving little use against superior German tanks and tactics. Most of those sent to France were abandoned after the evacuation of Dunkirk. Many Mk VIB's were sent to North Africa, where their high speed was used to flank Italian forces. Losses were high however and they were last used in East Africa in Febuary 1941. Several were later sent to Greece and a few even took part in the Battle of Crete.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Surprisingly some survived the war and were later used in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war under the Egyptian Army.

				The Tank, Light, Mk VII (A17), also known as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank of the Second World War. It was the successor to the Vickers-Armstrongs Mk VIB. The main improvement was the addition of the two pounder gun, a weapon usually found on the larger Infantry and Cruiser tanks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Less than two hundred tanks were produced overall. This was partly because the War Office wanted to concentrate on producing Infantry and Cruiser tanks but also because of the poor performance of other light tanks in the Battle of France. Those tanks that had been produced were soon pulled from service and the Tetrach as a whole was about to be declared obselete. This decision was halted in mid-1941 as Britain was begginning to assemble airborne forces. The Tetrach was identified as the ideal tank to be used in airborne operations. Successful exercises were conducted in which the Tetrach was landed with the aid of a glider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Tetrach finally saw service in 1942 in the battle of Madagascar, where they helped take the island from Vichy French control. It was last used in Operation Tonga as part of the airborne landings prior to D-day.

				The Tank, Infantry, Mk I, Matilda I (A11) was a British infantry tank of the Second World War. It is not to be confused with the later model Tank, Infantry Mk II (A12), also known as the "Matilda II" which took over the "Matilda" name after the early part of the war when the first Matilda was withdrawn from combat service.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				They were of totally different design and did not share components, but did have some similar traits because they were both designed to be infantry tanks, a type of tank that tended to sacrifice speed for increased armour protection.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Matilda I (55) and Matilda II tanks fought together in France as part of the 1st Army Tank Brigade of the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of France.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				They participated in the defence and counter-attack operation at Arras against the invasion by Nazi Germany in May 1940, temporarily discomfiting the 7th Panzer Division under Rommel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Tank, Infantry, Mk II, Matilda II (A12) was a British infantry tank of the Second World War. It was a marked improvement upon its predecessors, the Matilda I (A11), boasting a 2 pounder gun, thicker armor and numerous other technological improvements. However it's massive weight, nearly twice that of the predecessor, made it slow and cumbersome.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When war broke out in September, 1939, only two Matilda's were in service with the British Army. Nonetheless a small number of Matilda's did take part in the Battle of France where their thick armour proved a rude shock to the advancing German troops. Those tanks were later abandoned in the Dunkirk evacuation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Nonetheless production of the Matilda continued, and the tanks were sent to the newly established front of North East Africa. It was there, against a poorly equipped Italian force, that it earned it's nickname 'Queen of the Desert'. Its incredibly tough armor proved too thick for the Italian tanks and guns, and helped drive the axis forces across the Libyan desert.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				However with the arrival of the Afrika Korps its luck began to change. It proved vulnerable to the Germans new anti-tank guns, and was ill suited to the mobile warfare that was taking place. For a time it still proved a match for enemy tanks, but as newer and more powerful Axis models arrived on the battlefield it began to give ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Its successor, the Valentine tank, began to arrive in late 1941, replacing the increasingly obselete Matilda. What remained of the Matilda force in Africa was largely destroyed in the summer of 1942, in Operation Crusader, where they helped win Britain's first ground victory against German forces. However it continued to be used in other theatres, largely in the pacific, where they proved more than a match for Japanese forces, and became the only British tank to remain in service throughout the war.

				The Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine was a British infantry tank of the Second World War. The "A" designation was withheld from the tank since it was a private design from Vickers-Armstrongs, however the source of the name "Valentine" is unknown. Many claim it's because the design was first presented on valentine's day, others that it was the middle name of one of the designer. Some say it was just a random codename used by the company.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The successor to the Matilda II, it was no huge leap forward in tank evolution. With a similar top speed, armour thickness and arnament(at least at first) it's main draw was its smaller weight, lower silhouette and reduced production costs. It began trials in May 1940, coinciding with the loss of equipment in Dunkirk. Keen to replace losses, the War Office appproved the design and rushed into production to replace losses. During the war 8,275 were built in the UK and Canada, making it the most produced British tank design of the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It first saw combat during Operation Crusader and was used extensively throughout the African campaign. During the campaign it earned a reputation for reliability and good protection. However, like many tanks of its time, it's two pounder gun was insufficient to counter enemy tanks. Later variants were fitted with the six pounder but this was delayed due to a need to replace losses from Dunkirk.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was also used in the European theatre, but by 1944 it had been almost completely replaced by the Churchill (A22). It was also used extensively by Soviet forces, who recieved several thousand through the land-lease program. Serving from the Battle of Moscow until the end of the war its small size and reliability was popular among soviet troops.

				Despite the small number produced it managed to see combat in a variety of theatres. In France, Greece and North Africa its two pounder gun was lethal against early German designs, however its thin armor made it vulnerable to a variety of weapons.

However it soon became clear that it was not suitable for that role, and was reclassified as a "heavy cruiser".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Despite being originally concieved as an infantry tank it was found to be poorly armored, though its two pounder gun proved effective in the early stages of the war. Despite its many shortcomings it found service in a poorly equipped British Army. In France its cross country performance was critisized, however in North Africa its reliability was praised. Most of what remained of the Mk II's were sent to Greece.

				The Tank, Cruiser, Mk V, Covenanter (A13 Mk III) was a British Cruiser tank of the Second World War. Named after a Scottish religious faction during the War of the Three Kingdoms, it was the first British cruiser tank to be given a name.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Equipped with a two pounder gun common to British tanks of that era, its thin armor and high speed was in keeping with the philosophy of the cruiser tank. Its production was riddled with problems that continued throughout its liftime. Rushed into production just as war was breaking out, numerous issues meant the first tanks delayed production until after Dunkirk. A crippling overheating problem, one that was never fully solved, meant it wasn't sent to North Africa but instead kept behind for Home Defense. Pruduction continued even as better cruiser models became available and more than 1,700 were built.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Despite equipping several British Armoured Divisions it never saw combat. By 1943, just as new fronts were opening in which it could serve, the tanks were declared obselete due to its inability to counter new German designs. It was decided that tank's problems couldn't be solved without a major redesign and the tank was withdrawn from frontline service.

				The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VI, Crusader (A15), was a British Cruiser tank of the Second World War. It was one of the major British tank designs of the war, serving mostly in the North African theatre.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It first saw combat in early 1941, just as Rommels Afrikan Korps was driving British forces back across Africa. It first equipped the 7th Armoured Division, also known as the Desert Rats, and took part in Operation Battleaxe, where they suffered serious losses. Despite this setback it would continue to serve in Africa in more successful engagements such as Operation Crusader and the Battle of El Alamein, and even saw action until the end Tunisian campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Despite it's successful service several major problems were found with the Crusader. Overheating, the crippling fault of its predecessor, was still a problem in the African desert, as well as a proving prone to catch fire when hit. Furthermore its two pounder gun was quickly becoming obselete against new Axis designs, a common problem of British tanks at that time. When it became clear that the Crusader's replacement was being delayed the Mk III was introduced. Boasting a new six pounder gun, it greatly extended the liftime of the Crusader.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				However its importance in the British army eroded with the arrival of the American Sherman tank. With the completion of the African campaign its successor, the Cromwell, was finally available, and it was removed from combat. It continued to serve as AA mounts and tractor guns until the end of the war.

				The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VIII, Cromwell (A27M) was a British Cruiser tank of the Second World War. Named after the controversial English Civil War leader Oliver Cromwell it was a tank of the latter stage of the war, mostly seeing combat in the liberation of Europe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Development of the tank was much delayed and production didn't start until 1943. Recognising the shortcomings of its predecessor, the A15 Crusader, it incorporated heavier armour and a new, powerful gun, the QF 75mm. Despite this increase in weight the speed which defined the cruiser tank line was retained with its famed Meteor engine, meaning that it was even faster than comparable Sheman designs while boasting thicker frontal armor. However its 75mm gun, while slightly more powerful than the Sherman's, had difficulty penetrating new German armor, and paled in comparison to the 17 pounder gun mounted on the Sherman Firefly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It first saw combat during the Normandy landings. Although the tank was chiefly used in training roles a small number saw action in North-West Europe equipped to the armored reconnaissance regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps. After the war it continued to have a role in the British Army and was exported to several European countries. Several saw action in the Greek civil war, though they saw limited service and had very little effect on the overall outcome.

				The M4 Sherman Firefly was a British variant of the American Sherman tank. Essentially a regular Sherman tank with the gun replaced with the new British 17 pounder anti-tank gun, it quickly became a widely used variant within the British Army. It was the most common vehicle to field the 17 pounder during the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The idea of mounting a 17 pounder gun onto a Sherman tank had already been discussed within the British Army, but had been rejected several times in the belief that new British designs would surpass the Sherman. Eventually, after a long lobbying campaign by a pair of British officers, the concept was approved. This proved an excellent decision when it became clear that the new British tanks were to be delayed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Several problems became apparent when adapting the Sherman. The gun itself kicked up massive amounts of dirt and dust, blinding the crew and revealing the tanks position. Its recoil and muzzle blast was hard on the tanks crew, in some cases causing night blindness. And although the gun proved highly effective in countering the heavier German tanks the Shermans regular 75mm gun was found to be better against 'soft' targets such as light tanks and infantry and had a higher rate of fire. These problems were never elminated since the tank was seen as a stopgap until better British designs became available.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Despite these problems production began in January 1944. By Febuary 1945 over 2,000 Firefly's had been produced, and were equal in number to the unconverted Shermans used by the British Army. After this production was scaled down as new British Comet and Centurion tanks came into service and the war itself began to wind down.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Firefly first saw action in Normandy. With British and Commonwealth forces facing the bulk of German armor in the Battle of Normandy the Firefly proved itself vital in countering Germany's new Panther and Tiger tanks, in some cases able to eliminate the Panther with just one shot. So powerful were the Firefly's that German anti-tank crews were instructed give them priority when attacking. In response to this new tactic, as well as underlining the importance placed on it by allied commanders, Firefly's were generally held behind regular Shermans and provided fire support against enemy tanks. This tactic may have been responsible for lower losses Firefly's suffered in comparison to other Sherman tanks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It continued to be in use throughout the war, with Firefly's being used in the Battle of the Bulge and the crossing of the Rhine, and a few serving with distinction in Italy. Post war it was largely removed from service, though several other countries continued to operate it.

				The Tank, Infantry, Mk IV (A22) was a heavy British infantry tank used in the Second World War, best known for its heavy armour, large longitudinal chassis with all-around tracks with multiple bogies, and its use as the basis of many specialist vehicles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was one of the heaviest allied tanks of the war. This series of tanks was named after Winston Churchill,	who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Minister of Defence at the time, and had been involved with the development of the tank as a weapon during the First World War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				A few Churchills were in use for the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. The six Mk III tanks (with the 6 pounder gun) of "KingForce" went into battle in support of the 7th Motor Brigade. Although all were heavily shelled by German anti-tank guns, only one received more than light damage; one tank was said to have been hit up to 80 times.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In one encounter a Churchill tank got the better of a German heavy tank, Tiger I, when a shot lodged between the Tiger's turret and turret ring. The crew abandoned the Tiger, which was subsequently captured by the British. As the first Tiger captured by the Western Allies it was particularly useful, and is now on display at Bovington Tank Museum in the United Kingdom.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Churchills saw widespread action in Normandy as well as subsequent operations in the Low Countries and into Germany such as the fighting in Reichwald during Operation Veritable.

				The 7TP (siedmiotonowy polski - 7-ton Polish) was the Polish light tank of the Second World War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				A development of the British Vickers 6-ton, it was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German Panzer I and Panzer II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				A standard tank of the Polish Army during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, its production never exceeded 150 vehicles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Its chassis was used as the base for C7P artillery tractor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				All 7TP tanks took part in combat in the Polish Defensive War of 1939.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Most of them were attached to two light tank battalions (the 1st and the 2nd).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The remaining tanks, that is the ones used for training as well as tanks that were finished after the outbreak of the war, were used in an improvised tank unit fighting in the defence of Warsaw.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although technically superior to any of the German light tanks of the era, the 7TP was too scarce to change the outcome of the war.

				The Type 97 medium tank Chi-Ha was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Nomonhan against the Soviet Union, and the Second World War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was the most widely produced Japanese medium tank of World War II, with about 26mm thick armor on its turret sides, and 33mm on its gun shield, considered average protection in the 1930s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The 57mm main gun was a carry over from the 1933 Type 89 medium tank, and was designed to support the infantry, while the 170 hp diesel Mitsubishi was a capable engine for the tank in 1938.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				But was less effective after 1941 than most Allied tank designs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Type 97's low silhouette, asymmetric turret, semicircular radio aerial on the turret roof, complicated hull front, and seesaw-type suspension system combined to give the tank a unique appearance that distinguished it from other contemporary Japanese tanks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				One key to the Japanese success in Malaya was the unexpected appearance of their tanks in areas where the British did not believe tanks could be used. The wet jungle terrain did not turn out to be an obstacle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The 3rd Tank Group's tanks were particularly effective at the Battle of Slim River on 7 January 1942, where a company of 20 tanks under the command of Major Hajime Shimada destroyed the better part of the Indian 11th Infantry Division in about five hours.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Type 97-kai was first used in combat in the invasion of the Philippines at the Battle of Corregidor with the 4th and 7th Tank regiments. After this operation, the Type 97-kai was tested against a captured M3 Stuart light tank, and at a range of 1,000 meters, three out of six hits penetrated the M3's frontal armor. At a distance of 800 meters six out of nine hits penetrated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Type 97 tanks were also used by Imperial Japanese Navy SNLF armored units alongside naval infantry units in Pacific areas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				As the tide of the war turned against Japan, the Type 97s were increasingly expended in banzai charges, or were dug-in as pillboxes in static defense positions in the Japanese-occupied islands.

				The Fiat-Ansaldo M13/40 was an Italian medium tank ("M" for Medio (medium) according to the Italian tank weight standards at the time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The M13/40 was used in the Greek campaign in 1940 and 1941 and in the North African Campaign.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The M13/40 was not used on the Eastern Front; Italian forces there were equipped only with Fiat L6/40s and Semovente 47/32s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Beginning in 1942, the Italian Army recognized the firepower weakness of the M13/40 series and employed the Semovente 75/18 self propelled gun alongside the tanks in their armored units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The M13/40 was a conventional light tank of the early war period, similar in capability to other Vickers-derived designs such as the Polish 7TP and Soviet T-26.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				With a weight of 13 tons, it carried armor comparable to its opponents of 1940-41, and sufficient firepower to engage the British tanks of 1940-41.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The P40 was an Italian World War II tank design. It was armed with a 75 mm gun and an 8 mm Breda machine gun, plus another optional machine gun in an anti-aircraft mount.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The official Italian designation was Carro Armato ("armored tank") P 26/40. The designation means: P for pesante (Italian: "heavy"), the weight of 26 tons, and the year of adoption 1940.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Design had started in 1940 but very few had been built by the time Italy signed the armistice with the Allies and the few produced afterwards were used by the Germans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The P40 design was reasonably up-to-date, but the tank was without some modern features such as welded armour, modern suspension, and a cupola for the commander.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The armour, quite resistant by Italian standards, was capable of protecting the tank against early anti-tank guns such as the British QF 2 pounder (40 mm, 1.6 in), but was vulnerable to 1943 anti-tank weapons such as the British QF 6 pounder (57 mm, 2.24 in) and QF 17 pounder (76 mm, 3 in) which were capable of piercing more than 100 mm (3.9 in) of armour at typical combat ranges.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Also, compared to welded armour, riveted armour is vulnerable to breaking apart at the joints meaning that even quite resistant plates can be defeated by rivet failures.

				The M4 Sherman, formally Medium Tank, M4, was the primary tank used by the United States during World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Thousands were also distributed to the Allies, including the British Commonwealth and Soviet armies, via lend-lease.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In the United Kingdom, the M4 was named after Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, following the British practice of naming their American-built tanks after famous American Civil War generals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Subsequently the British name found its way into common use in the U.S.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The M4A1 Sherman first saw combat at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 with the British 8th Army.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4A1s in Operation Torch the next month.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				At this time, Shermans successfully engaged German Panzer IIIs with long barreled 50 mm L/60 guns, and Panzer IVs with short barreled 75 mm L/24 guns.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Encounters with a company of Tiger Is, with their heavier armor and 88 mm L/56 guns, in Tunisia were typical of the mid-war period:	the fearsome quality of a few German heavy tanks and their crews could be overcome by the quantity and mobility of the Shermans, supported by artillery and airpower, but sometimes at a great cost in U.S. tanks and crewmen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				By June 1944, the Panzer IV had been up-gunned with a 75 mm L/48 weapon, and 75 mm Shermans were out-gunned on a regular basis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76 mm gun in July 1944 was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3.

				The Kliment Voroshilov (KV) tanks were a series of Soviet heavy tanks, named after the Soviet defense commissar and politician Kliment Voroshilov.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The KV series were known for their extremely heavy armour protection during the early war, especially during the first year of the invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Almost completely immune to the 7.5 cm KwK 37 and 3.7 cm KwK 36 guns mounted on the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks, until better guns were developed often the only way to defeat a KV was a point-blank shot to the rear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Prior to the invasion, about 500 of the over 22,000 tanks in Soviet service at the time were of the KV-1 type. When the KV-1 appeared, it outclassed the French Char B1,[1] the only heavy tank used in the world at that time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Yet in the end it turned out that there was little sense in producing the expensive KV tanks, as the T-34 medium tank performed better (or at least equally) in all practical respects.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Later in the war, the KV series have become a base of development of the Iosif Stalin tanks.

				The Amiot 354 was the latest in a series of fast, twin-engine bombers which fought with the Armée de l'Air in limited numbers during the Battle of France. It was designed int the mid-1930s and the first orders were ordered in 1938, but production delays and ordered modifications ensured that September 1939 saw no delivered aircraft. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Eventually, the ordered number of this bomber reached 830, though ultimately only 80 machines were received by the Air Ministry and so it had no impact on the campaign of France, and disappeared less than six months after commissioning. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				But this medium bomber was a very modern aircracft, and could reach 298 mph (480 km/h). It had a range of 2,175 miles (3,502 km) and could carry 2,650 lb (1,200 kg) of bombs. Moreover, the Amiot 350 had 2 x 7.5 mm machine guns and one 20 mm cannon as defensive weapons. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

It first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and flew on all fronts in which Italy was involved during World War II. It became famous and achieved many successes as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

However, although it entered service with the Regia Aeronautica in 1941, it never replaced the SM.79, being retired from service before it. Basically it was an enhanced SM.79, with more modern solutions and systems. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

It could carry up to 11,000 lb (5,000kg) of bombs, had a range of 2,300 miles (9,300 km) and could reach 275 mph (443 km/h). [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The PZL.37 was a Polish twin-engine medium bomber, used in the defense of Poland against the Nazi German Invasion in 1939. It was designed in the mid-1930s in Warsaw, and the first serial aircraft were produced in 1938. Before the war it was one of the world's most modern bombers. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was able to carry a heavier bombload than similar aircraft, with 5,690 lb (2,580 kg) of bombs.  Smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, it was relatively fast with a maximum speed of 256 mph (412 km/h) and had a range of 1,615 miles (2,600 km). But its defensive armament consisted of only 3 machine guns, which proved too weak against enemy fighters. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				During the Invasion of Poland, from 4 September some PZL.37 were attacking German armoured columns in day attacks, forced by the desperate situation to perform this mission for which they were not designed (the original plans to bomb targets inside Germany were quickly abandoned), and They suffered heavy losses due to lack of fighter protection [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Hawker Hurricane was a single-seat fighter that served with the Royal Air Force during World War Two. It was largely overshadowed by the Supermarine Spitfire, which was percieved by the British public as the RAF's main fighter. Contrary to this perception it was the RAF's workhorse during the earlier years of the war, serving in all major theatres and playing a decisive role in the Battle of Britain. A highly vesatile fighter it would serve the RAF in multiple roles, as interceptor, fighter-bomber, and ground support aircraft.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				When the Hawker Hurricane was first proposed in the mid 1930's the RAF was in a poor state. Its thirteen squadrons was filled with biplane designs, clearly obselete in the face of advanced German designs. The Hurricane was designed to help the RAF match other modern design. However even as it began production it was obselete, using outdated construction methods and fabric wings. The fabric wings were quickly replaced with a metal covered wings, though some fabric winged aircraft were still in use through the Battle of Britain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				With production starting in June 1936, the Hawker proved relatively easy to construct and manufacture. It was cheaper to produce than the Spitfire, requiring 10,300 man hours to the Spitfire's 15,200. Thanks its easy construction the RAF managed to equip itself with eighteen operational squadrons of Hurricanes by the start of the war, almost 500 aircraft. Around 14,000 Hawer Hurricanes were produced overall, including the Sea Hurricane and other variants. The Hurricane served with numerous Air forces around the world, including allied countries, neutral, and even some Axis forces. Nearly three thousand aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union as part of the land lease program, though they were largely dissapointed with the aircraft, considering them inferior to both German aircraft and their own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Hurricane is generally considered an inferior fighter to the Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109, being far slower than both designs. Its thick wings also reduced its acceleration but allowed it to out-turn both aircraft. It was still capable of defeating the Messerschmitt, performing best in lower altitudes, though duing the Battle of Britain a common tactic was to leave enemy fighters to the Spitfire while the Hurrican went for the Bombers. A Mk II variant was introduced in September 1940, with a more powerful engine and arnament, though the aging fighter was still unable to match other designs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Hurricane served across the world, though its most famous engagement was during the Battle of Britain. Despite the Spitfire being percieved as the main RAF fighter it was actually the Hurricane that was fielded in larger numbers. It accounted for 55% of German losses during the battle, though the Spitfire had a much higher victory-to-loss ratio. It would also serve in North Africa, notably in the defense of Malta where they relieved the legendary Gloster Gladiator aircraft that had defended the island against far superior forces. In Egypt it proved capable of defeating early Italian fighters, though by late 1941 German reinforcements had relegated the Hurricane to a fighter-bomber role, with impressive results. This switch from fighter to fighter-bomber was repeated in all theatres as more advanced enemy fighters appeared and new British designs were produced in large enough numbers to replace them. By 1944 the Hurricane was no longer used in front line operations.

				The Spitfire Submarine was a single-seat fighter that served with the Royal Air Force and many other nations during World War Two. It was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft, becoming the only British aircraft in continuous production throughout the war and served as a front line aircraft into the 1950's. Designed as a high speed interceptor, it was used in multiple roles as interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber, carrier aircraft and trainer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Although the first aircraft were ordered back in June 1936, and a prototype aircraft flew at an airshow a few days later, the first production aircraft was not ready until mid 1938. This was largely because the Spitfire factories that were to produce the aircraft were already at full production fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stanraer flying boats. Other factories faced delays as well, largely because Vickers-Armstrong, the parent company, was reluctant to release the blueprint to outsiders. The kinks in the production process were eventually ironed out, though by the time the Battle of Britain was fought the Hawker Hurricane was still the more numerous aircraft. Soon after the battle had concluded it replaced the Hurricane as the backbone of the RAF and saw action in theatres across the globe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The aircraft itself was a highly advanced design, able to compete with contemporary aircraft and found to excel at high altitudes. It was comparable to the Messerchmitt Bf 109, both being advanced, high speed, high performance aircraft that went through numerous variants throughout the war. New variants of the Spitfire largely played catch up with German designs: when the new F variants of the 109 was introduced it exceeded Spitfire Mk I and II's, with the Mk V restoring parity. When the Focke-Wulf Fw-190 was introduced it inflicted high losses on the Mk V aircraft, with the Mk IX restoring parity. The Spitfire was continuously improved throughout the war and new variants were created even after the war had ended.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Spitfire was used in multiple theatres around the world. Its first action was during the "phoney" war, where nine Junkers 88's attempted to attack a pair of cruisers in the Firth of Forth. Two of the 88's were destroyed and another was heavily damaged. During this time Spitfires were kept in Britain for "Home" defense, despite a request for reinforcemnts by the French government, and instead four squadrons of Hurricanes were sent. It would soon see major action in the Battle of France, providing fighter support to the beleaguered low land countries and aiding in the evacuation of Dunkirk. It played a pivotal role in the Battle of Britain, fighting alongside the more numerous Hurricanes. Being the more powerful fighter of the two the Spitfire was generally used to intercept enemy fighters while the Hurricane attacked enemy bombers. Despite this tactic the Spitfire was responsible for over 40% of German losses and had a highter victory-to-loss ratio than the Hurricane.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After the Battle of Britain it largely suplanted the Hurricane as RAF's primary fighter. It took part in RAF offensives in North West Europe post Battle of Britain, performing fighter sweeps and escorting bombing missions. These had limited successes, with the Spitfires encountering the same difficulties the Messersmchmitt faced in the Battle of Britain. As the American strategic bombing campaigns gathered pace in Europe the Spitfire was found to have an insufficient combat range to escort the bombers, so while American aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang escorted the long range bombers into Germany the Spitfire largely continued its interceptor role, as well as escorting several short range bombing missions into France and the Netherlands. During and after the Normandy landing the Spitfire returned to prominence, helping allied air forces establish air supremacy over the continent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Spitfire first saw overseas combat in 1942 as reinforcements in the Siege of Malta, an action which finally began to ease the island's perilous situation. Soon after they became available to forces in North Africa and later in Italy. In the Pacific theatre the Spitfire was used by commonwealth forces against the Japanese, fielding their Zero fighters. The Spitfire found the Zero to be a dangerous opponent and was unable to compete in a prolonged dogfight. Pilots had to adopt a "slash and run" tactic using their superior speed to dive at the Zero and then speed away to avoid attack. Post war the Spitfire saw combat in the Greek civil war, the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the 1947 Indo-Pakistan war and the Malayan Emergency.

				The Vickers Wellington was a British twin-engine, long range medium bomber designed in the mid-1930s in response to specification B.9/32, which called for a twin-engined day bomber of perceptibly higher performance than any previous designs. It could reach 235 mph (378 km/h), had a range of 2,550 miles (4,106 km) and could carry up to 4,500 lb (2,041 kg). [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The aircraft was very vulnerable to attacking fighters, having neither self-sealing fuel tanks nor sufficient defensive armament. In particular, while the aircraft's nose and tail turrets protected against attacks from the front and rear, the Wellington had no defences against attacks from the beam and above, as it had not been believed that such attacks were possible owing to the high speed of aircraft involved. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				As a consequence it was widely used as a night bomber in the early years of the Second World War, before being replaced byt the Heavy bomber Avro Lancaster. The Wellington was popularly known as the Wimpy by service personnel, after J. Wellington Wimpy from the Popeye cartoons. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

				The Messerschmitt Bf 109 was a single-seat German World War II fighter aircraft. First produced in the early 1930's it was the most advanced aircraft of its time, leading the way in aircraft development. Despite being introduced several years before the war started it remained in production and in service right up until Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945. With over 33,000 produced it became the most produced fighter aircraft in history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				As the fledgling Nazi regime began the rearmament of Germany it announced a competetion to produce a single seat fighter that would act as a high speed interceptor. After a close competition with the Heinkel He 112 the 109 was awarded the contract. The Bf 109 was one of the most advanced aircraft created at the time, with a closed canopy, retractable landing gear and a powerful, liquid cooled engine. Numerous other design features lead to a simplified construction process as well as excellent handling characteristics and a top speed that exceeded many of its contemporaries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Messerschmitt Bf 109 went through serveral variants that allowed it to remain a competitive fighter throughout the war. Early A/B/C/D variants were used in the Spanish civil war and were largely withdrawn before the war started, though a few were used in the opening stages of the Poland campaign. The E variant was a major redesign of the Bf 109, gifting the aircraft with a more powerful engine as well as a major redesign of the airframe. This was the main variant used during the early stages of the war. It was replaced by the F variant, which again incorporated a new engine, as well as being found far more aerodynamic. The G series, the final variant of the Bf 109, was a less radical redesign than previous variants though included numerous improvements over the F series. A naval variant was also considered for a time, the Bf 109T, with the Kriegsmarine recognising the potential of aircraft carriers. Several 109T's were produced and used in tests, though the aircraft carrier it was to serve on was never finished and the 109T was releagated to training aircraft.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The Bf 109 first saw action in the Spanish civil war. They served with the Condor Legion, a groud of Luftwaffe volunteers, who fought with Nationalists forces against the Soviet aircraft of the Republican forces. This pre war combat proved vital in giving combat experience to German pilots as well as providing a testing ground for the early variants of the 109. The E variant saw combat in Germany's early victories, like Poland and France. It was also the main fighter used in the Battle of Britain, where the Luftwaffe attempted to gain air superiority over the British mainland in preparation for a full scale land invasion. Numerous factors led to Germany's defeat in the battle, chief among them was the inability of the Luftwaffe to suppress British fighters. Although the Bf 109 was superior to the majority of British fighters (with the possible exception of the Spitfire) the need to escort bombers and its small operating range meant it was unable to realise its full potential.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The introduction of the Focke-Wulf Fw-190 meant the 109 was largely replaced in Western Europe, though it continued to be the prominent fighter in other theatres, such as the Eastern Front, the Balkans, and as part of the Afrikan Korps. In the Eastern Front the 109 was vital in establishing air superiority against the Soviets, inflicting massive losses against the Soviet Air Force. Even as the invasion came to a grinding halt the 109 still ruled the skies. However a lack of resources and the collapsing German Army meant the 109's effectivness was reduced and was unable to maintain air superiority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				In the later stages of the war it led the Defence of the Reich, the defensive aerial campaign aimed to protect German military and civil industries from allied strategic bombing. As the war reached its conclusion reduced resources and the loss of trained pilots meant the Luftwaffe and the 109 ceased to have any noticable effect on the course of the war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				After the war the 109 remained in service with numerous air forces in Europe, mostly with neutral air forces that had recieved the fighter before the fall Nazi Germany. Ironically a small number of 109's served with the newly formed Israeli Air Force for a time and fought against the Spitfires of the assembled Arab forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli, the last time these two rival aircraft would ever face each other on the battlefield.

				The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was a single-seat German World War II fighter aircraft. First introduced in mid-1941 it proved superior to existing fighter aircraft, including Germany's own Messerschmitt Bf 109. It was largely used as a low altitude interceptor and as a ground attack aircraft, a role in which it was highly successful. Despite being regarded as superior to the 109 in several key areas it never managed to replace the 109 as Germany's sole fighter, instead both aircraft forming the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was designed to be a backup to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 from the beggining, with the German government concerned that future rival aircraft could outclass the 109. It was designed to be fast and durable, compared to a "cavalry horse" in contrast to the 109 "racehorse". In this case it was largely successful. Its small wing platform meant it suffered less drag and was able to acheieve higher speed and range, but it also meant that the 190 had difficulty generating lift and was unable to compete at high altitudes, meaning it was mostly used as a low altitude fighter. Later variants attempted to create a high altitude version. The development process of the 190 was plagued with engine problems, with the enire progrma threatened with closure several time. However it succeeded in producing the 190, and by the end of the war over 20,000 aircraft had been produced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				There were several main series of variants. The A series continually built on the 190's success as a low altitude fighter and fighter-bomber. With over 13,000 built it formed the majority of 190's. Attempts to turn the 190 into a viable high altitude aircraft that could counter American heavy bombers culminated in the D series. The F and G series turned the 190 into a more dedicated ground attack aircraft, with thicker armor and wing mounted arnament. Later design and production deteriorated as Germany's war effort faltered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It first saw combat in August 1941 in France, in an effort to counter RAF attacks in the area. It proved so advanced that it managed to wrest air superiority from the RAF for almost a year until the improved Mk IX variant of the Spitfire appeared and restored parity. It would continue to provide fighter support in this and also attack shipping in the channel until the D-day landings. After that it saw heavy action, utilised in both air superiority and ground attack roles. However losses were heavy, and with insufficient replacements the Luftwaffe lost air supremacy to the allied air forces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				It was unable to play a major role in the Eastern Front, instead being sent west to counter the British and American air forces. The Eastern front was largely left to the Messerschmitt Bf 109, though several hundred 190's did see service in Russia. Their first appearance was in September 1942, during the Battle of Stalingrad. However Soviet forces considered the 190 to be the inferior aircraft of the two, contrary to the opinions of both Western and German air forces. As the Soviets began their long campaign to drive the German's back new Soviet fighter designs, as well as the inability of German forces to replace losses, meant that the Luftwaffe began to lose the air superiority it had enjoyed since the beginning of the campaign. Despite these losses the 190 was able to resist the Soviet advance up until the very last days of the Third Reich, attacking the bridgeheads on the River Oder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				The 190 also fought in the last months of the North African front and served throughout the Italian campaign. Postwar the aircraft served with several foriegn air forces, though in small numbers and never seeing combat.
